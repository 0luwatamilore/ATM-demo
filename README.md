# ATM-demo
Project Title: ATM Software

Project Description: 
This Project was written using Java programming language with a javafx Interface package. This software potrays a demo of what a valid user can do with the proper credentials. 
The program has a stored database for about 100 users with their information such as Account_Number, Account_Name, PIN, and Available_Balance.
With this a user can view his Available_Balance, make a withdrawal, and make a deposit with currency in USD($).

How to Run: 
All the user has to do to initiate the program is to compile and run the Screen.java file.

How it Operates: 
1) The user compiles the Screen.java file.
2) Next the user would have to input the correct Account Number and PIN in order to move from the login page to the menu page. Login credentials can be found in the BankDatabase.csv file.
3) At the menu page the user can then decide what action he wants to perform.
